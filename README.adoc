== Activity:

=== Find out the average number of transactions by account. Get those accounts that have more transactions than the average.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE avg_count_trans
SELECT
    avg(avg_no_of_transactions_by_account) AS avg_count_trans
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            (

            ) AS avg_no_of_transactions_by_account
        FROM
            trans
        GROUP BY
            account_id

_First I calculate the average number of transactions by account, then calculate the total average which is 192. I have separated the output into accounts with a number of transactions equal or below average and accounts with a number of transactions above average. If I display only the average number of transactions by account the output would be an averages per account from 6 to 548. This would have been redundant as the second part of the question asked me to display accounts that have more transactions than the average. And the total average of transactions is 192._

== Activity:

=== Get a list of accounts from Central Bohemia using a subquery.

* Rewrite the previous as a join query.

* Discuss which method will be more efficient.

== Activity:

=== Find the most active customer for each district in Central Bohemia.
