== Activity:

=== Find out the average number of transactions by account. 

* Get those accounts that have more transactions than the average.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE avg_count_trans
SELECT
    avg(avg_no_of_transactions_by_account) AS avg_count_trans
FROM
    (
        SELECT
            (

                    avg(count(account_id))
            ) AS avg_no_of_transactions_by_account
        FROM
            trans
        GROUP BY
            account_id
    ) AS t;

_First I calculate the average number of transactions by account, then calculate the total average which is 192. I have separated the output into accounts with a number of transactions equal or below average and accounts with a number of transactions above average._

_If I display only the average number of transactions by account the output would be the averages per account from 6 to 548. This would have been redundant as the second part of the question asked me to display accounts that have more transactions than the average._

== Activity:

=== Get a list of accounts from Central Bohemia using a subquery.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT account_id
FROM
    account
WHERE
    district_id IN (
        SELECT
            DISTINCT A1
        FROM
            district
        WHERE
            A3 = 'central Bohemia'
    );
```

* Rewrite the previous as a join query.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    account_id,
    a3 AS region
FROM
    `account` a
    INNER JOIN district d ON a.district_id = d.a1
WHERE
    a3 = 'central Bohemia';

* Discuss which method will be more efficient.
